            - Refreshing can be invoked now also with the refresh() method or by sending
              the viewport a GE_TICK event.
            - near clipping plane changed from 0.5 to 0.1.

	* Renderers/OpenGLRenderer: bugfix, primary camera scaling was
	still applied to the projection matrix instead of the modelview
	matrix. fixed.

2007-11-16  Paul Wagner  <>

	* Renderers/OpenGLRenderer, Graphics/Viewport: Removed
