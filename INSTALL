Installing the Lifespace Simulator
----------------------------------

Dependencies
------------

Boost (http://www.boost.org/). Only headers are needed. Tested with
boost-1.50.0.

Open Dynamics Engine (http://ode.org/). Tested with ode-0.8 using double
precision floats.

GLOW (http://glow.sourceforge.net/). Tested with glow-1.0.4.

OpenGLUT or freeglut (http://openglut.sourceforge.net/,
http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/). Tested with freeglut-r738. There are
issues with certain versions of freeglut. See the glow plugin reference
manual for details. 

Installing
----------

1) Run 'make' in this directory (must be GNU make!). This will compile
   everything (the main library, plugins, tests and examples) and put
   the main library into the include/ and lib/ directories under this
   directory. Other available targets:
     lib               compile the main library and put it into lib/
                       and include/ dirs.
     plugin_glow       compile the GLOW Toolkit plugin and put it into
                       lib/ and include/ dirs.
     test              compile all testcases in the test/ dir.
     examples          compile all examples in the examples/ dir.
     clean             remove all unneeded temporary files.
     cleantest         remove the compiled testcases and temporary files.
     cleanexamples     remove the compiled examples and temporary files.
     cleanbin          remove all compiled libraries and headers
                       (deletes the lib/ and include/ dirs).
     cleanall          cleanup everything.

   If yoy get the error message "Unrecognized platform id: ..." then
   check the file Makefile.common in this directory, set the platform
   id there manually to the closest supported (see comments in that
   file for details) and try to adjust all relevant variables to match
   your environment.

2) Add or copy the include/ dir into your include path and lib/ dir
   into your library path.

3) Using the library:
   Include the main library in your program:
     #include <lifespace/lifespace.hpp>
     using namespace lifespace;   // optional, of course
   Include needed plugins. For example:
     #include <lifespace/plugins/glow.hpp>
     using namespace lifespace::plugins::pglow;   // optional
   Link against needed libraries. For example:
     g++ ... -llifespace -llifespaceglow -lode -lglow -lGL ...
     (see the makefiles in the examples/ dir for reference)

Notes
-----

1) When compiling the final app, the Open Dynamics Engine library and
headers that are used must have the same configuration (float/double,
debug/release) which was used when compiling the lifespace library!

2) You _can_ use the old GLUT instead of the suggested newer
replacements, but expect instability and odd behaviour with some input
functionality.
