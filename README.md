Lifespace Simulator
===================

_Copyright (C) 2004-2005 Paul J. Wagner_

version 0.0.31

The Lifespace Simulator is a simulation platform for creating three-dimensional
worlds with realistic physics, real-time visualization and user- and
computer-controlled entities. The simulator is written in C++ using OpenGL and
the Open Dynamics Engine. No control algorithms are included.

I have developed the simulator as a part of various course projects during my
undergraduate studies. These courses include several computer graphics and
virtual reality courses and an artificial intelligence course. The simulator is
probably of no general use as more mature alternatives exist, but is made
available for the curious.

For publicly available client software that uses the simulator or is built on
some early incarnation of it, see [The Incredible Environment](http://iki.fi/paul.wagner/projects/tie/)
(a virtual reality application developed during a software project course) and
[OtaCombat](http://iki.fi/paul.wagner/projects/otacombat/) (a game
developed during an artificial intelligence course).
